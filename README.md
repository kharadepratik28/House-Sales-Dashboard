This interactive dashboard can be filtered on the basis of calendar, house year built, house square foot living area & house square foot lot. The following questions can be answered:

What's the day wise average of house sales price?

What is the distribution of house prices across the range?

What is the distrubtion of number of bedrooms in the house?

What is the distribution of number of bathrooms in the house?

Comparison between the view & the condition of the house based on average pricing.
